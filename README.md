# AutoKait - Automated Irish Gauge Player

## Overview

The automa Kait (**K**ait the **A**utomated **I**rish **T**ransport, a.k.a. AutoKait) is an automated A.I. player designed to be used for the board game, Irish Gauge.

The original concept and design was based on an existing Irish Gauge automa called CAIT (Chase's Automa for Irish Transit). Whilst Kait closely follows the princibles or dice rolls to determine Kait's next move, the future versions of AutoKait will hopefully expand to be more deterministic in how it chooses their next action.

The project has since turned into a little side passion project to create board game A.I. and in turn investigate artificial intelligence in general.

>Please be aware that this automa was written as an exercise in learning the Python 3 language.
> 
> The code may have potentially questionable, non-standardised or non-conventional practices and implementations.
> 
> Please be kind. I'm happy to hear about any improvements.
